-- Simple Storage Policies for Avatars Bucket
-- Make sure you've created a PUBLIC bucket named "avatars" first

-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload own avatar" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own avatar" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own avatar" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view avatars" ON storage.objects;

-- Allow authenticated users to upload to their own folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow authenticated users to update their own files
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow authenticated users to delete their own files
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow public read access (so avatars are visible to everyone)
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');
